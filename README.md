- 👋 Hi, I’m @JojoCodeCode
- 👀 I’m interested in exploration. I don't know what I want to do with coding yet- I just know I like it. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java and python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Although I don't have much input to give at this point. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm well-adjusted.
